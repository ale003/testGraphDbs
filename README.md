Simple java benchmark to test blueprints sail graph.

At the moment the benchmark works for Titan, Orient and Neo4j.

The benchmark is generating an RDF graph of articles and authors with random relations between them. To have a faster data generation,
 at each step the data is written in the graphDb and then some sparql queries are executing against the data.

The data already generated is in TrialsData. In GraphDbsAll there is also data from other trials done in AllegroGraph and Virtuoso (not with this program).
